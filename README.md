# A repository to begin building a website which allows council managers to fully use biodiversity metrics from a specific urban greenspace

Overall workflow:



Will eventually split this repository into multiple repos once the project is further fleshed out.

The main steps include:

1.) Delineate urban greenspaces as test locations

2.) Convert eBird data to sql db

3.) Spatially query the sql db based on the urban greenspace .geojson files

4.) Run analyses on the data for each greenspace and save results/plots

5.) Export results/plots for each greenspace which can be used for website development
