# Background
This web-app provides summarized data for urban greenspaces throughout the world, working to summarize [eBird data](https://ebird.org/home). eBird is a large citizen science project with > 500 million observations globally. 

# Purpose
The purpose of this web-app is to provide council managers, local land management groups, and any other interested parties with detailed information about the species richness of their local urban greenspaces. We have been working on understanding the value of eBird data at an urban greenspace --- [see here](http://www.publish.csiro.au/wr/Fulltext/WR17141) --- as well as understanding how eBird data can be used to estimate biodiversity metrics within urban greenspaces --- [see here](http://www.ace-eco.org/vol12/iss2/art12/). For detailed methods, see [this paper](http://www.ace-eco.org/vol12/iss2/art12/). Reporting rate is defined as the number of eBird checklists which a species occurs on, for a given greenspace.

# Contribute
If you are interested in contributing to this initiative, we ask that you upload your bird sightings to eBird, where they will automatically be included. If you have a greenspace you would like to be assessed, please see this page with instructions on how to submit an urban greenspace.
